For this project we worked with the data retrieved from a differential drive robot for its localization in a certain area by the means of the Extended Kalman filter (EKF).

- **Part 1:** Development of a Kalman Filter for the self-localization.
- **Part 2:** Development of an Extended Kalman Filter for the self-localization.
